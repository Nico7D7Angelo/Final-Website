<h1>This is my last and final website, I don't want to make anymore website.
 I liked this class alot. The programing part was hard and I hate that 
I missed the pizza thing but oh well. The thing I liked most about this class was the programing because thats pretty much all we did.
 So far I enjoyed the website I made for my mom. I'm probably going to get a B or c because eventualy im going to 
get lazy. How many sentences have I writen? Oh well this is the end of my 8 sentences.</h1>
